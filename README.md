# W55RP20-EVB-Pico-TFLM-PersonDetectionExample

This project integrates the W55RP20-EVB-Pico board with an Arducam camera to create an AI-powered person detection system. Using a TensorFlow Lite model, the board performs real-time person detection and transmits the results via Ethernet to a local TCP server. Ideal for edge AI applications, this setup leverages the W55RP20â€™s robust networking capabilities, making it perfect for IoT and smart vision use cases.
